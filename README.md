# About

This is a skeleton of microservices development based on spring using kafka/zookeeper for event driven architecture. Code provides; 

'DataSource, MyDataProcessor, DataSink' 

together with events pipeline built as docker containers


## Pre-requisites

In order to test this application in a docker environment; you must have docker and docker-compose installed. 


## Monitoring

Monitoring of Kafka queues is done through Grafana therefore, Kafka needs to be started with JMX exporter from prometheus. Prometheus/Grafana are integrated with application for perormance and kaka queues monitoring. 


## Building for Production with Docker 

Since Kafka/Zookeeper are required for publisher/subscriber messaging system, a docker file is provided that already contains kafka, zookeeper, prometheus, graphana and graf_db images. To fully dockerize this application and all the services that it depends on, build with production profile with docker support as below;

	Download repository and execute following in root directory

	./mvnw package -Pprod docker:build


## Initialize Docker Containers

To initialize docker container run below command from root directory:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml down

## Accessibility

Kafka mertics exposed through JMX is visible here;
    
    http://<IP-ADDRESS-OF-KAFKA-BROKER>:8080/metrics

Grafana Dashboard is accessible here

## Troubleshooting

In some instances, you will notice failure while building because following environment variables need settings;

DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/<username>/.docker/machine/certs/

DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376

DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1

like;

export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376
